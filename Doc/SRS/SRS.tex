\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

For many years, Nintendo have been re-releasing NES games for the their other platforms using built in emulators to give the users the same experience of The Legend of Zelda since 1986. With no changes made to the way the game plays in the last 32 years, we aim at modernizing the way The Legend of Zelda will be played by recreating it with new technologies. 

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Customer}

The customer for this project will likely be one who is familiar with The Legend of Zelda series as a whole and would like to experience the original version of the game built upon new technologies. The customer could also be one who has experienced the original game and they would like to compare the two versions.

\subsubsection{The Teaching Assistants and Professor}

The TAs and Professor are directly involved with the project as they are viewing from its start to completion and will being giving guidance on the the various deliveralbes for the project.

\subsubsection{The Developers}

We as the developers are the primary driving force behind the project and will be doing all of the testing, design, aswell as learning new technologies and implementing them into our development for the project.

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
    \item This program will be able to be run on a computer with  Python3 and the Pygame library
    \item This program will be controlled by the user through their keyboard inputs
    \item This program will output through a display window on the user's monitor
    \item This program will be completed by the assignment-set deadline
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Individual Product Use Cases}

This product has two main use cases, which are operation by the consumer and viewing and editing by a developer. This product, a game, has it's main use case within a user downloading and playing it. This is the main purpose of the program being built. A side use case would be looking at the code, by teaching assistants and professors, and also any developers who come across the project online, and would like to know how it functions and would like to learn and build off of it, similar to what is being done with this project.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Requirement FR1\\ The program must only read inputs from the keyboard connected to the system it is running on\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To ensure other devices are not obstructing the user in interacting with the game inapporpriately.}
    
    \item Requirement FR2\\The program must only process inputs that would perform an action in the game\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To only update the game state based on any intended inputs, avoiding undetermined results.}
    
    \item Requirement FR3\\Once the program is running, the program must only take input/output through one display window.\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To ensure no other external windows/applications are sending inputs to the software when executed.}
    
    \item Requirement FR4\\The program must have a menu on start-up, allowing a user to {\color{blue} start the game by pressing the [K] key}\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To allow user to choose when to begin the game.}
    
    \item Requirement FR5\\The program must have a pre-defined map, which the player accesses through large tiles (two-dimensional divided sections of the entire map)\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To ensure the user is bounded by the designed areas of the game.}
    
    \item Requirement FR6\\The program must only allow the player within one tile of the map at a time, and when the end of a tile is reached, the player is transported to the tile next to the current, depending on where the player has exited (if the player leaves the top of the tile, they will be moved to the tile above their current tile)\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To ensure the player can access different levels of the game in a rationale manner.}
    
    \item Requirement FR7\\The program must have different objects in the map, such as walls which the player and most NPC's cannot pass.\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To ensure NPC's are unable to access areas of the game, in a way that the game logic is undetermined and to ensure the user does not skip designed areas of the game.}
    
    \item Requirement FR8\\ The program must have items which only the player can collect\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To allow user to track their progression of the game by collecting player specific items.}

    {\color{blue}Rationale: To ensure user is only controlling one playable character at a time. This game is intended for single-player use.}
    
    \item Requirement FR13\\The user must be able to control the controllable character with keyboard inputs  once in-game, to move [W,A,S,D] , attack[K], and use an item[L]\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To allow user to control the player character.}
    
    \item Requirement FR14\\The program must have other non-playable-characters (NPCs) within the game\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To allow variety of characters for user to encounter while exploring the game}
    
    \item Requirement FR15\\The program must have enemy NPCs, which move and attack with pre-defined logic by the game\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To allow user to interact with other entities in the game.}
    
    \item Requirement FR16\\The program must have different enemy "classes", with different health amounts, movement speeds, attacks and attack damage values\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To allow variety for the user when exploring the game.}
    
    \item Requirement FR17\\When the player collides with an enemy NPC, or an enemy NPC attacks the player, the player takes damage, and their health amount is reduced by a values within the range of from 0.5 - 2 hearts\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To allow feedback for the user when interacting with NPC's, ensuring the NPC attacks are registered on the player character.}
    
    \item Requirement FR18\\When the player attacks an NPC, the NPC's health is reduced by a set value\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To allow feedback for the user that the attack input has been registered and has changed the state of NPC character.}
    
    \item Requirement FR19\\When the health amount of a character (NPC or player) is reduced to 0, the entity is deemed "dead"\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To ensure the user and NPC are not invincible and can defeat enemies and be defeated, as is documented in the original game.}
    
    \item Requirement FR20\\When an NPC is dead, it is removed from the current room, and has a chance to drop a heart object or an in-game currenct object. The chance of this drop is randomly generated for each NPC.\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To reward the user for defeating an enemy.}
    
    \item Requirement FR21\\The program must have 3 consumable items: hearts, an in-game currency and keys\\\\

    {\color{blue}Rationale: To allow user to continue playing the game even after taking damage from enemy characters.}
    
    \item Requirement FR23\\When the player collides with a  heart/in-game currency consumable object, it is immediately used on the player\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To allow user to use items while the player is moving, not breaking immersion from the game. }
    
    \item Requirement FR24\\The player must be able to open a locked door if the player collides with the door and they have minimum 1 key. This action will consume a key and bring the player's key count down by one key\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To ensure user cannot reach an area of the game without exploring certain portions of the game.}
    
    \item Requirement FR25\\When the player is dead, the game is over, and the user is given the options to return to the main menu, or quit the game using the [K] and [Q] keys respectively.\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To allow user option to continue the game from the beginning after reaching the death screen or to quit the game indefinitely. }
    \item Requirement FR26\\The program must have an objective to follow, getting certain collectible items, and once all set items are collected, the game is completed\\\\
    {\color{blue}Rationale: To give user reason to continue playing the game and to eventually complete the entire game. }
    
    \item Requirement FR27\\The program must have in-game shops, special rooms within the map where the player can buy items with their in-game currency collected over the span of the game\\\\

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The decision on how the screens are going to be rendered have yet to be made, the current two avenues of thought are loading the whole map and moving the camera around, or only rendering one screen at a time and having room transitions.
    \item The decision to allow for diagonal movement has been pondered as it is a feature in most topdown 2d games these days, but it doesn't blend well with the way movement is already set up in the original game.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions} 

There are several off the shelf solutions already available to consumers. Nintendo has re-released The Legend of Zelda multiple times across multiple platforms, with the most recent version being released as recently as September 2018 as part of the Nintendo Switch online service. These releases are available to consumers, however they are all emulated versions of the original 1986 game release. These products still offer the same experience content wise, however it still runs from the original code and has not been remade with new technologies comparable to what we will be working with.

\subsection{New Problems}

\subsubsection{Potential User Problems}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The new game will not run on original hardware, meaning that it will not be playable on Nintendo systems.
    \item This allows for the two products to exist separately as the platforms are different (Nintendo systems vs personal computers).
    \item The new system will not displace any previous implementations as it is a single player game and there is no playerbase to disrupt.
    \item The new system will not have any impact on the speedrunning community as they are dedicated to using the original NES version of the game.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tasks}
{\color{blue} The problem tasks are set by delivers that needed to be completed for the course SFFWR ENG 3XA3. The final demonstrations have to be completed by December 4th 2018 for Lab Section 1. The final document deliverables are due on the December 5th 2018 with all encompassing files regarding software documentation that have been created need to be updated. Additional documents such as the Test Report and User Guide need to be created for the final deliverable date. Revision 1 for final documentation should have all documents completed with properly annotated coloring for additional points added/altered in the final documentation.}


\subsection{Migration to the New Product}

N / A - As the product is standalone from previous implementations (i.e. A whole new unrelated system)

\subsection{Risks}

As the project has been stated to be ambitious, the main risk that faces us is excessive schedule pressure. There is quite a number of features that need to be implemented and fully understood on our end to be able to pull off a project as ambitious as this. There are two possibilities, it will either take more time than anticipated to implement all of the features we want, or we reduce the scope of the project to meet deadlines. All of this will depend on time management, and more ambitious goals may be toned down at later points in development.

\subsection{Costs}

There is no monetary cost to this project as nothing needs to be bought and we are working for free. Timing costs can be estimated from the tasks that must be completed to meet these deliverables. Time estimates are very rough.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Creating tile maps and sprite rendering: ~8 hours
    \item Creating basic player object with movement: ~4 hours
    \item Add in collision detection for player and intractable objects: ~6 hours
    \item Add in items for the player: ~14 hours
    \item Add in enemies with AI: ~30 hours
    \item Scripting Dungeons: ~40 hours
    \item This all totals to around 102 hours of work for the the primary basis of the project.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}

User documentation should be handled with a small manual that explains basic controls and some descriptions of the enemies, mechanics, and items. The main goal is to introduce the ideas of the game to the user to allow for a better understanding of the main gameplay concepts to allow for a more enjoyable experience.

\newpage
\subsection{Waiting Room}

{\color{blue} The software application should have an user interface to allow users to manage the audio levels for different channels of sounds in the game such as the music, sound effects, etc. The program should also allow users to assign custom keys for movement and interaction using a user interface. These such additions should be accessible when at the main menu of the game.\\

The software application can be added upon the current created framework to generate several other complete levels. Each level would have several other objectives/NPC's to encounter when executing the software application. 

}

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}

{\color{blue} A solution to the user interface settings menu would be similar to how the different states of the game are handled. The settings menu would be a seperate state that would be accessible using a designated key command. This would load the settings state of the game and would allow users to modify the audio levels for each channel and map the keys accordingly.}
