X-------------------------------------X

This section will cover the quick background and hopefully answer
any questions you may have about the origins/development of this
game.

=> {1.1} About this game
	This game is a remake of the origial The Legend of Zelda,
released on the NES in 1986. We decided to remake this game since
we all saw it both as a classic and fun experience to play, and
as something we could build part of in the time frame given. Our
new implementation is created using python3, a user-created game
making library called pyGame, and make for running all the files
together.

|          II. Running/Playing	      |
X-------------------------------------X

This section will cover any topics dealing with running the code,
in-game controls, and any environment interactions you should be 
aware of before you start your journey into the game!

=> {2.1} Starting The Game
	To run, this game has some dependencies that need to be met by
your system. This game runs on python3, using the pyGame engine,
which can be installed at the following links, respectively:
https://www.python.org/downloads/ (Version 3.7.1 or greater)
https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml (Can also be installed
using console commands (eg. pip install pygame))
This game also uses make to run its main and depending files, which
should already be installed, but if not, go through the guide for
your specific system on how to install.
	Once these have all been installed properly, to run the game,
navigate your terminal to the parent folder of the game (containing
the Makefile), and run 'make' in the console. If a window appears,
it is working! If not, refer to your terminal for the error, as one
of your dependencies may not be installed properly.

NOTE: This game cannot be run off of running the main.py file in
	python, it needs to be done through make!

=> {2.2} User Controls
	Once you have passed the main screen by pressing k, and waited
through the brief loading screen, you will be greeted by a small
green-and-brown character in the middle of a room. This is you! For
the sake of the guide, they will be referred to as the "player". The
player has both basic movement and attack functionality linked to 
keys on the keyboard. These interactions are listed below:
+-----+-------------------------------------+
| Key | Function                            |
+-----+-------------------------------------+
|  W  | Move player up                      |
|  S  | Move player down                    |
|  A  | Move player left                    |
|  D  | Move player right                   |
+-----+-------------------------------------+
|  K  | Sword attack (damage enemy)         |
|  L  | Boomerang attack (stun enemy)       |
+-----+-------------------------------------+
|  M  | Mute in-game music                  |
|  N  | Un-mute in-game music               |
+-----+-------------------------------------+

=> {2.3} Environment Interactions
	Your player has multiple interactions and variables to look out for!
Firstly, the top black bar above the room is the HUD, and will keep track
of your health, rupy count, and key count. Your health will start at 3,
and will go down when colliding with enemies, and go up by picking up
heart items. Your rupy count is a count of your in-game currency, which
can be incremented by picking up rupy items, and used in a secret room! The
key count is the count of how many keys you currently have, which can be
incremented by picking up a key. Whenever there is a door with a keyhole
in it, it requires at least one key to open. Walking into the door for half
a second will decrement your key counter, and permanently open the door.
	There are also enemies to watch out for in the game! When you enter a
room with enemies, all doors (except for locked doors) will be "blocked",
meaning that they will not open until all enemies in the room are defeated.
There are two types of enemies and one boss. Hitting an enemy/boss with
your sword will take away one health point from them, and hitting them 
with your boomerang will stun them for a set amount of time, stopping them
from moving and attacking. If an enemy collides with you, though, you
will be hurt for a set amound of damage, depending on the enemy. Lose all
three hearts and you will die!
	The "keese" enemy is an enemy which mimics a bat. It can move around
to random places, even through walls. They have one health point, will
take away half a health point from you if you collide with them, and can
drop either a rupy or a heart.
	The "stalfos" enemy is an enemy which mimics a skeleton. It walks in
a random direction, changing whenever it collides with a wall, player, or
after a set time. They have two health points, will take away one health
point from you if you collide with them, and can drop either a rupy or a
heart.
	The "aquamentus" boss is the final boss of the game! It walks back
and forth, shooting fireballs, which deal one health point of damage.
It has five health points, and colliding with it will deal two health
points of damage to the player. Aquamentus does not drop anything, but
is defending a serious reward!
	Once a room has been cleared of all enemies/bosses, the blocked doors
will open, and some set rooms will give you a key or multiple rupys. It
is not random which room will drop which, it is impossible to softlock the
game. So if your path is blocked by a locked door, try going down other
paths, going into rooms you haven't been before to try to find a key!

Good luck and have fun!

|        III. Health and Cultural Concerns       |
X------------------------------------------------X
This section addresses any outstanding issues regarding health and safety 
concerns when operating the software and aswell as any potential idealogical 
commentaries that the software application potentially invokes.

=> {3.1} Take Breaks Between Play
	This game is meant to be enjoyed by the you, the player, but this enjoyment 
should not come at the cost of your personal health. Remember to take frequent
breaks between gameplay sessions and to ensure you take at least a 15 minute 
rest between sessions lasting longer than 60 minutes. Please remember, its a video
game its supposed to be fun! It's no fun when you are tiring yourself out!

=> {3.2} Potential Similarities
	Any similarities regarding any cultural, historical, political figures/event/beliefs 
are purely coincidental and do not represent the intent of the creators of this project.
